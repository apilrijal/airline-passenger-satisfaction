# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

This project focuses on analyzing airline passenger satisfaction to uncover key factors that influence customer experiences. By leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques, the goal is to provide actionable insights for improving airline services and enhancing passenger satisfaction.

# Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in passenger feedback.
Visualization of key satisfaction metrics using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict passenger satisfaction.
Analysis of demographic, service quality, and flight-related factors that impact satisfaction levels.

# Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
